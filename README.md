## 📝 Description
The Snitch Fashion Sales Dashboard is a complete end-to-end analytics project built in Excel. The raw dataset contained missing values such as Unit Price, Segment, and Order Date, which were cleaned using business logic and Excel formulas. Analytical operations including SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, SUMIF, IF, and VLOOKUP were applied to calculate KPIs like:

- Total Sales
- Average Sales per Order
- Total Profit
- Total Quantity Sold

Pivot Tables and Charts were used to build an interactive dashboard containing slicers and cards. The dashboard visualizes sales trends across Cities, Product Categories, and Months to provide meaningful business insights.
